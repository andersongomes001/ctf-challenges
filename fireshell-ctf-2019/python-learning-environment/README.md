# Description

It's good to have a place to practice your python skills online. Can you find the flag in this strange environment?

# Flag

# Write-up

Basic PyJail with some WAF. Numbers, [] and specific keywords.

To see the exploit, please see xpl.py

xpl.py could be way easier, but I decided to remove some characters on the blacklist and it was way easier to solve :)
